Config maps

k8s store environment(env) and files of lets say DB port , DB connect (examples) in a container or a pod , so to reduce complexity devops use config maps(cm) to store the files and cm can deploy these stored files too, for all this cm uses etcd. 

only non sensitive data should be stored in cm cause etcd can be hacked, for secure data k8s uses 'secrets'

Secrets allow user to encrypt the etcd .
2 ways k8s will encrypt by default or user can do custom encryption.
