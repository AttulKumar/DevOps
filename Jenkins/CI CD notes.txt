CI CD 

ci cd automates the basic steps which are performed before uploading an app to store .
These steps are:

1.
unit testing
testing that the code is giving desired result.

2
static code analysis 
checking that the code doesn't have unnecessary variables, indentation right  etc.

3
code quality\vulnerability
app should not be vulnerable and of high quality .

4
automation\functional testing
the function only does the required job like only addition should be done in a function not multiply or divide, it is also end to end testing.

5
reports
reporting of the result , faults and quality.

6
deployment
deploying app in store so that it is available to customers.

##########
a developer makes a app version and submit it to github , he keeps submitting until he get the best version 
He breaks it to chunks called jira files and each version is tested automatically by ci cd or called automation testing .

eg Jenkins is a ci cd pipeline tools which will deploy n number of tools which will do automation testing .
like stages 
1 maven
2 sonar 
3 reporting 
4 k8s /ec2

all these tools will be integrated and deployed  by Jenkins automatically .

############################
Jenkins promotes app to 3 stages
1.Dev
where QA test and developers run app in simple env. like ec2 instance .

2. stages
here load on app is put and seen like master(M) slave(S) architecture.
3M 5S in stages 
so each app is tested in a single node than in multiple nodes.

3. production 
here the app is same as the app deployed in store 
3M 30S so after app does well in previous stages step than only it is promoted for this step ......... same goes for dev to stage promotion.

##############
Jenkins can't handle large no. of servers due to high cost computing power need so an alternative is required.
