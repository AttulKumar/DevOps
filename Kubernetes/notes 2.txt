load balancing  k8s and replica problems 

see l images

service.yml file type :-
 it will only see the labels and selectors 
eg if there are 100 pods but the labels have only MyApp specified so it will only work on pods with MyApp .

curl -L ( for redirect ) 

the port 3007 works as nodeport ie the organisation can only access it ( img )

if want the pod to be public just , kubectl edit "filename" than change type to load balancer (rather than node port).

in LB if you put 6 curl commands to 2 pods than the LB will divide them 3 3 on each pod .
