containers c1 c2

host network
host container stores c1 c2 on same docker file but doesn't work in high security architecture like login and finance

Bridge network 
c1 gets network error while connecting to host ip so bridge called veth (virtual ethernet ) is in docker for this  used for this problem

bridge is used for finance security problem 
log in out to veth ( c1 c2 )
c3 payment to v bridge i.e external docker created by run --network command and is connected to the host

#############
in SS of c.. series as we see that 
the login and logout (c1,c2) have ip address in similar range i.e. 172.17....
where as when we create a secure network the ip is completely isolation from the c1 c2 i.e. 172.19....
