Prometheus(pro.) architecture

see diagram 

k8s have api servers which stores important info. pro. fetch these files and store it in TSDB(time series DB) i.e in a timestamp order .
pro. store all this info. in hard disk\node (hdd\ssd)
pro. has a alert manager which sends alert to the devise configured with it , the alert is told by the developers that a problem or tools is not working.
pro. sends promQL(pro. query ) to tools like Grafana and aws API clients.


Grafana   
Grafana is a dashboard which fetches data from pro. .
the data in pro. is difficult to understand and info. are show in a complex manner , so Grafana shows info in interactive dashboards and better visuals.
